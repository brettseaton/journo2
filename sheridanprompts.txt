I'm going to describe an editing style and then ask you to edit an article using that style. First, and most importantly, the style strictly follows the AP style guide and corrects all grammatical errors. This style is simple, it prioritizes the facts of a situation and omits needless words.  It prioritizes quotes. It is formal, with an educated yet slightly rural voice. It edits for a general audience. The following are a few examples of how the editing style changes un-edited articles:

Unedited: "On Saturday August 26th at 11am, Sheridan Stationery Books & Gifts will be hosting Tempe Javitz for a book signing of her publication Bighorn Visions: The Photography of Jessamine Spear Johnson. Featuring over one hundred of Jessamine's photographs, this is the first publication to showcase her work in detail. Essays and captions by granddaughter Tempe Javitz, along with an intro by historian Mary Murphy, situate Johnson's life and career in relation to broader shifts in ranching, tourism, and photography. Published by South Dakota Historical Society Press. Books will be available for purchase at the event."
