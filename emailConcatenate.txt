Please reorganize text that I am about to provide to you into the following format:
"ARRESTS
Michael Garrett Adams, 32, 19 Powerline Place, for domestic battery. Held on a $6,000 bond.

CITATIONS
Ledjor Rowden, 19, of Wamego, for possession of an open container at about 11:20 p.m. Aug. 19. while near the intersection of North 11th St. and Claflin Road.

INCIDENTS
Officers reported criminal use of a financial card at about 2 p.m. Thursday in the 2800 block of Anderson Avenue. Peerless Tires told police that someone purchased tires with a stolen credit card for a loss of about $1,020."

Make sure that all of the information is preserved from the text I will provide, and just reorganized into the above format where ARRESTS are listed first, then CITATIONS, then INCIDENTS. Here is the text I'd like you to reorganize:
